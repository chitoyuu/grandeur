**Work-In-Progress: Probably don't use for anything in case this got somehow into the public web.**

This crate implements a generic abstract Update-Render-Reconcile-Thing. It's development is being driven by use cases in a private project and is currently very volatile.

Currently the architecture implemented resembles The Elm Architecture, with a lot of the work being done by the backend.
